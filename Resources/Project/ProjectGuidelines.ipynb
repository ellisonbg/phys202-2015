    "This document describes the final projects that you will do for this course. These projects will build on your existing knowledge and take you to the next level with your skills in coding, software engineering, visualization, debugging, algorithmic thinking, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between this project and the previous homework you have done?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project will be **a lot more work** than a single homework (the project is worth the same as all of your homework).\n",
    "* The project will be a much more accurate representation of what it is like to do computational physics \"in the wild\".\n",
    "* The project is **open ended**. For most of your homework, there has been a very clear result you are aiming for, and I pick the target. With the project, I will give you general guidance, but you will have significant freedom to create and explore questions. Because of this you won't know the right answer and neither will I.\n",
    "* While multiple students will be doing a project on the same topic, each project will be **entirely unique** in the questions explored and the approach to those questions.\n",
    "* The end result of your project will be a **computational narrative**, i.e. a *story*, that uses code, data and visualizations to communicate something of significance. You will tell this story to the class in your final presentation.\n",
    "* The project is a **capstone experience** that will tie together everything you have learned and likely require you to learn a lot of new things we haven't covered in class.\n",
    "* Most importantly, the project will be a lot of **fun** and provide you with something significant you can use as the start of a computational portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schedule for the project work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Week 7: Projects are assigned on Wednesday, Day 14.\n",
    "* Week 8: Class dedicated to active project work time.\n",
    "* Week 9: Memorial Day on Monday, **Progress Report** due on Wednesday, Day 18.\n",
    "* Finals Week: **Final Project Deliverable** due at beginning of official final time, **Presentation** during official final time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other practical guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask GitHub for a free educational account [here](https://education.github.com/) to give you free private repos.\n",
    "* Create a new GitHub repo for your project and add me (ellisonbg) only as a collaborator.\n",
    "* Your Progress Report and Final Project Deliverables will be turned in by pushing to your private repo.\n",
    "* After you have given your Final Presentation, you can optionally make your repo public so you can use it as a computational portfolio.\n",
    "* All questions and discussions related to the project should take place on the main gitter channel for the class. I will not reply to private emails related to the project."

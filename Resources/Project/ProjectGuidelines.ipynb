    "What is the difference between this project and the previous homework you have done?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project will be **a lot more work** than a single homework (the project is worth the same as all of your homework).\n",
    "* The project will be a much more accurate representation of what it is like to do computational physics \"in the wild\".\n",
    "* The project is **open ended**. For most of your homework, there has been a very clear result you are aiming for, and I pick the target. With the project, I will give you general guidance, but you will have significant freedom to create and explore questions. Because of this you won't know the right answer and neither will I.\n",
    "* While multiple students will be doing a project on the same topic, each project will be **entirely unique** in the questions explored and the approach to those questions.\n",
    "* The end result of your project will be a **computational narrative**, i.e. a *story*, that uses code, data and visualizations to communicate something of significance. You will tell this story to the class in your final presentation.\n",
    "* The project is a **capstone experience** that will tie together everything you have learned and likely require you to learn a lot of new things we haven't covered in class.\n",
    "* Most importantly, the project will be a lot of **fun** and provide you with something significant you can use as the start of a computational portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schedule for the project work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Week 7: Projects are assigned on Wednesday.\n",
    "* Week 8: Class dedicated to active project work time.\n",
    "* Week 9: Memorial Day on Monday, **Progress Report** due on Wednesday.\n",
    "* Finals Week: **Final Project Deliverable** due at beginning of official final time, **Presentation** during official final time.\n"

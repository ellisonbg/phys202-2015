    "* Make sure it will be obvious to me what each notebook contains and which order I should go through them in.\n",
    "* If there are cells or notebook that take longer than 30-60 seconds to run, you should put a uppercase bold warning in a markdown cell immediately above the cell: **THIS CELL TAKES XXX MINUTES TO RUN**. I won't run these cells.\n",
    "* You should make sure that your notebooks will run without error wth a cleared kernel, from the top to the bottom, *leaving out the long running cells*. This will require you to save the output of long running cells to disk and load them back for analysis and visualization purposes. Yes, I will run your code!"
